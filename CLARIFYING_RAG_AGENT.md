# ü§ñ **Clarifying RAG Agent - Enhanced AI System**

## üéØ **Overview**

The Clarifying RAG Agent is an advanced AI system that intelligently handles ambiguity, provides step-by-step confirmations, and maintains context-aware conversations. It represents a significant upgrade from traditional single-LLM approaches.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **Agent Orchestrator** (`server/services/agentService.js`)
   - Manages conversation state and workflow
   - Routes between retrieval and action tools
   - Handles ambiguity detection and confirmation

2. **Retrieval Tools** (`server/services/tools/retrievalTools.js`)
   - Safe, read-only database operations
   - No user confirmation required

3. **Action Tools** (`server/services/tools/actionTools.js`)
   - Write operations requiring confirmation
   - Protected by validation and confirmation workflows

4. **Agent Prompts** (`server/config/agentPrompts.js`)
   - Human-friendly clarification questions
   - Confirmation prompts for actions

## üîÑ **Workflow**

```
User Message ‚Üí Intent Analysis ‚Üí Retrieval Tools ‚Üí Ambiguity Detection ‚Üí Clarification ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Action Tools ‚Üí Response
```

### **Example Workflow**

1. **User:** "Add 100 credits for John"
2. **Agent:** Detects ambiguity ‚Üí "I found 2 customers matching 'John'. Which one did you mean?"
3. **User:** "John Smith"
4. **Agent:** Moves to confirmation ‚Üí "I'm ready to apply $100 in credits... Is this correct?"
5. **User:** "Yes, proceed"
6. **Agent:** Executes action ‚Üí "Credits applied successfully!"
