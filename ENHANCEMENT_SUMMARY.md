# TransMaster Pro - Enhanced AI Chat System

## 🚀 New Features Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive enhancements made to the TransMaster Pro invoice reconciliation system to handle advanced customer service scenarios including quantity discrepancies, damage reports, and automated credit memo generation.

## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. Quantity Discrepancy Handling
- **Scenario**: Customer reports missing or incorrect quantities received
- **Example**: "Invoice INV-2025-001 billed 100 units but we received 95. Fix?"
- **Processing**: 
  - AI extracts invoice ID, missing quantity, and item details
  - Python microservice calculates credit amount based on unit price
  - Generates draft credit memo with approval workflow
  - Offers appropriate options based on payment status

### 2. Damage Report Processing
- **Scenario**: Customer reports damaged items received
- **Example**: "We received a damaged 4L60E transmission on invoice INV-2025-002. The case is cracked."
- **Processing**:
  - AI extracts invoice ID, item description, and damage details
  - Creates damage report with unique ID
  - Generates credit memo for full item value
  - Provides refund or account credit options

### 3. Intelligent Credit Options
- **Paid Invoices**: 
  - Apply credit to account for future purchases
  - Issue refund to original payment method
- **Unpaid Invoices**:
  - Apply credit to current invoice
  - Apply credit to account for future purchases

### 4. Enhanced AI Intent Recognition
- **New Intents Added**:
  - `quantity_discrepancy` - Missing/incorrect quantities
  - `damage_report` - Damaged items
  - `credit_memo_approval` - Customer responses to credit options
- **Improved Extraction**: Handles complex scenarios with multiple data points

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Enhanced Mock Database
```javascript
// New fields added to invoices
{
  paymentStatus: 'paid' | 'unpaid',
  items: [{
    quantity: 100,
    receivedQuantity: 95,
    unitPrice: 50,
    damageReported: true,
    damageDescription: "Cracked case"
  }]
}

// New collections added
creditMemos: [...],
damageReports: [...]
```

### Python Microservice Enhancements
```python
# New methods added
def process_quantity_discrepancy(...)
def process_damage_report(...)
def approve_credit_memo(...)
def _get_credit_options(...)
def _apply_credit_to_invoice(...)
def _add_credit_to_account(...)
```

### Node.js Server Enhancements
```javascript
// New handlers added
async function handleQuantityDiscrepancy(...)
async function handleDamageReport(...)
async function handleCreditMemoApproval(...)
```
