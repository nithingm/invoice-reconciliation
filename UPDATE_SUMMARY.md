## Test Results

### Before Update:
```
‚úÖ Matched pairs: 3 (including wrong matches)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Discrepancies: 0 (missed wrong matches)
‚ùå Unmatched credit memos: 0
```

### After Update:
```
‚úÖ Matched pairs: 2 (only valid matches)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Discrepancies: 2 (correctly detected wrong matches)
‚ùå Unmatched credit memos: 1 (the problematic one)
```

## Validation Rules Implemented

### 1. **Customer Name Validation**
- **Rule**: Customer names must match exactly
- **Penalty**: 50% confidence reduction for mismatch
- **Impact**: Prevents wrong customer credit memos from being matched

### 2. **Date Sequence Validation**
- **Rule**: Credit memo date must be after invoice date
- **Penalty**: 20% confidence reduction for wrong dates
- **Impact**: Ensures logical chronological order

### 3. **Amount Validation**
- **Rule**: Credit amount cannot exceed invoice amount
- **Penalty**: 25% confidence reduction for excessive amounts
- **Impact**: Prevents over-crediting

### 4. **Vendor Validation**
- **Rule**: Vendor names should match (if available)
- **Penalty**: 15% confidence reduction for mismatch
- **Impact**: Ensures vendor consistency

### 5. **Currency Validation**

- **Impact**: Prevents currency-related errors

## Types of Discrepancies Detected

### 1. **WRONG_CREDIT_MEMO_MATCH**
- Customer name mismatch
- Date sequence issues
- Amount exceeds invoice total
- Vendor mismatch
- Currency mismatch

### 2. **DUPLICATE_CREDIT_MEMOS**
- Multiple credit memos referencing the same invoice

### 3. **ORPHANED_CREDIT_MEMO**
- Credit memo references non-existent invoice

### 4. **LARGE_CREDIT_AMOUNT**
- Credit amount is more than 50% of invoice amount (suspicious)

## UI Improvements

### New Display Sections:
1. **üìà Analytics Dashboard**
   - Match Rate percentage
   - Average Confidence score
   - Total amounts and differences
   - Discrepancy breakdown by severity

2. **‚úÖ Valid Matches**
   - Invoice and credit memo numbers
   - Customer information
   - Amount details
   - Confidence scores
   - Match reasons

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancies Found**
   - Discrepancy type and severity
   - Detailed descriptions
   - Affected invoice/credit memo numbers
   - Validation details

4. **‚ùå Unmatched Items**
   - Unmatched invoices with details
   - Unmatched credit memos with reasons

## Business Impact

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies suspicious credit memo patterns
- **Data Quality**: Ensures only valid matches are processed
- **Audit Compliance**: Provides detailed discrepancy reports
- **Financial Control**: Prevents incorrect credit applications

### Operational Benefits:
